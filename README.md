## Task 1: Importing and transforming tables in Power BI 
Before any analysis took place I first imported the required tables(Orders, Products, Stores & Customers) using the the get data button in the home tab. After importing each table individual I then loaded the tables to be transform using the transform data button (Pic 1) then after completeing the required transformation I rename columns and the table names to ensure that they were in line with Power Bi naming conventions then clicked close & apply to save the change. An example of some of the transform that I made was in the Orders table were I separated data and time in separate coloums using the split coloumn function and split the column using the a common delimiter (,). I also remove duplicates from the product_code column in the products table by selecting the column and clicking remove column and selecting remove duplicates.
